ðŸŽ¬ AI Short Films and Generative AI Projects: A Journey into Creative AI Engineering ðŸš€
Welcome to my collection of AI-generated short films, prompt engineering experiments, and Generative AI tools! In these projects, I explore the power of AI storytelling, prompt-driven visuals, and interactive experiences, showcasing the full potential of combining Prompt Engineering with Generative AI technologies.

ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects:
AI Short Films:

INTO THE VIBE: A story of escape from stress to peace, using AI-generated visuals and emotional storytelling.

TURNING POINT: A story of friendship, resilience, and personal growth, told through AI-driven prompts and character design.

INTO THE LIGHT: A thrilling journey of a girl through a stormy forest, using AI to bring fear and hope to life.

ETERNAL BONDS: A beautiful love story exploring love, loss, and rediscovery, powered by generative AI tools.

Prompt-to-Portfolio Tool:

A dynamic web tool built to transform any user bio or resume into a beautifully designed personal portfolio, driven entirely by prompt engineering and Generative AI.

AI Image & Video Generator:

Created an interactive tool where you input prompts to generate AI-powered images or even video clips. A seamless fusion of prompt engineering with real-time generative capabilities.

ðŸ§  Tech Stack & Tools Used:
ChatGPT for storytelling, dialogue generation, and scriptwriting

Leonardo.Ai for AI-generated imagery (anime style)

Runway ML for video transitions and scene rendering

Pixabay for sound effects and background audio

ðŸ’¡ How These Projects Work:
These AI-driven projects rely heavily on prompt engineering, which involves creating specific, well-structured text prompts that instruct the AI on how to generate creative output. The stories and visuals are crafted by breaking down the narrative into key scenes and then feeding these into AI models to produce character designs, storylines, and video sequences.
